## Unreleased

### Added

- The project's mission (`SOUL.md`), agent instructions and repository hooks.
- `layercraft compile`: a 3MF through exact layer sections, walls, solid shells and sparse
  infill, toolpaths, timed moves and `verify`, to a `.gcode.3mf` for the Bambu Lab X2D.
- `--emit STAGE=FILE` and `--from STAGE=FILE` at every stage (mesh, sections, regions, paths,
  program).
- `layercraft machine import`: the printer, process and filament read once from an installed
  Bambu Studio's profiles; the printer's own G-code templates expanded by a strict interpreter.
- `layercraft view`: a SolidCraft script drawing the toolpaths, one sketch per layer and role.
- `layercraft compare`: two G-code files side by side, layer by layer and feature by feature.
